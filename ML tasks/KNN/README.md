# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (From Scratch)
## Overview
This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch** using Python and NumPy.  
The model is tested on the **Iris dataset**. Confusion matrix and classification report are generated using `sklearn.metrics`.

## How to Run

1. **Download the project folder**

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
